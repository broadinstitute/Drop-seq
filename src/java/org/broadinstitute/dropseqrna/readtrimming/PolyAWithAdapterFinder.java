/**
 * Look for adapter sequence at the end of read, and start search for polyA before the adapter sequence.
 * Note that if the entire read is adapter, the entire read is trimmed.  If some adapter sequence was found,
 * a polyA run at least minPolyALength is considered unless the entire read before the adapter is polyA.
 * If no polyA run was found, and the adapter sequence length is <= dubiousAdapterMatchLength, the search
 * is repeated as if no adapter sequence was found.
 * If no adapter sequence was found, polyA need only be minPolyALengthNoAdapterMatch, because some of the
 * polyA tail might not be captured in the read.  
 * The longest sequence of polyA with mismatch rate <= maxPolyAErrorRate is the polyA tail.
